Python syntax is very similar to English. This makes it a very easy language to learn for beginners.

Here are some basic Python syntax rules:

Variables are declared using the var_name = value syntax.
Strings are enclosed in single or double quotes.
Comments are started with the # symbol.
Indentation is used to indicate the scope of blocks of code.
