ntroduction

Python is a high-level programming language that is easy to learn and use. It is a general-purpose language, which means that it can be used for a wide variety of tasks, including web development, data science, and machine learning.


Python is an interpreted language, which means that it does not need to be compiled before it can be run. This makes it a very versatile language, as it can be used on a variety of platforms.

Python is also a very powerful language. It has a large library of built-in functions, and it can be extended with third-party libraries. This makes it a great choice for a wide variety of projects.



Python syntax is very similar to English. This makes it a very easy language to learn for beginners.

Here are some basic Python syntax rules:

Variables are declared using the var_name = value syntax.
Strings are enclosed in single or double quotes.
Comments are started with the # symbol.
Indentation is used to indicate the scope of blocks of code.
